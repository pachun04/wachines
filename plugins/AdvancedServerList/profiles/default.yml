#
# Set condition(s) that should return true to display this profile.
# This allows you to create profiles to only show for specific scenarios (i.e. player is banned).
#
# Multiple conditions can be chaing with the keywords 'and', 'or', or their counterparts '&&' and '||'.
#
# No condition or an empty condition will be treated as true by default.

condition: ''

#
# Set one or multiple profiles.
#
# A profile can contain the same options as used in the file itself, except for priority and condition.
# If multiple entries are present, a random one will be selected. Any options set in the selected profile will override
# any existing option in the file.
#
# Example: The below profile configuration will randomly change the MOTD between two types, but keep the Hover text
#          the same.
#
# When not present or empty (profiles: []), no profiles will be used and global options from the file will be used instead.

#
# Set the "Message of the day" to display.
# This option supports RGB colors for 1.16+ Servers and clients, including gradients using MiniMessage's <gradient>
# option.
#
# Only the first two lines will be considered and any additional one is ignored.
#
# When not present or empty (motd: []), no MOTD will be set.

#
# Set the Favicon (image on the left of a server entry) to display.
# This option supports three types of inputs:
#
#   1. Name, including .png extension, pointing to an image located in the plugin's favicons folder.
#   2. "random" to display a random PNG from the favicons folder.
#   3. URL pointing to an image.
#   4. Player name, UUID or placeholders returning one of these.
#      https://mc-heads.net will be used to retrieve an image of the provided name/UUID.
#
# Note on favicons not showing:
#   AdvancedServerList has to create a Favicon object for the Proxy/Server to use which takes time to do so.
#   To not delay the Proxy/Server from being displayed (increase the loading time on the player end) is this creation
#   done asynchronously for URL/Player name/UUID. This has the downside that the Proxy/Server may be done handling the
#   ping before the Favicon is created, causing none to be displayed.
#   Note that this won't happen with local favicons, as those are created during the plugin's startup.
#
# Any images above or below 64x64 pixels will be automatically resized to these dimensions.
#
# If not present or empty (favicon: ''), defaults to not modifying the favicon.
